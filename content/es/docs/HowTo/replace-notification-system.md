  Disable Rofication and add another notification system.

Regolith ships with a notification system called [Rofication](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/Rofication).  This system is designed to work in the background and not use pop-ups as a way of alerting the user to a new notification.  Rather, a small bar item displays the current number of unread notifications and a dialog can be loaded to view and delete them.  This page is allows you to enable a more traditional notification UI.

For this exercise we'll use [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) but similar steps can be used for other notification components.

1. Install dunst: `sudo apt install dunst`.  This should cause `rofication` to be uninstalled.
2. Log out and back in.  Test your notifications with `notify-send test123`.  You should see a pop-up from `dunst`.
